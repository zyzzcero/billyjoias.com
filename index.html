    style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Georgia'>Do you
                love gourmet chocolate?</span></p>
                <p><span lang=EN-US
    style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Georgia'>Most people do! Fine chocolates are one of life’s
                  greatest pleasures. Kings and princes have for centuries coveted chocolate.
                  Did you know that chocolate used to be one of the expensive items in the
                  world, almost as precious as gold? It’s true! Chocolate makers who mastered
                  their craft went on to become very wealthy and famous, establishing some of
                  the world’s most well known companies. People today still love chocolate.
                  It is a part of many people’s daily life and also can be a wonderful treat
                  and reward. Life without chocolate would truly be a sad and empty life.</span></p>
                <p><span lang=EN-US
    style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Georgia'>For
                  some people though eating chocolate is fraught with hazards. If you’re
                  watching your weight then one of the first things that experts tell you to
                  do is cut out rich chocolate that is loaded with sugar and calories. Do
                  you have special dietary restrictions that make it difficult for you to
                find chocolate that you can eat?</span></p>
                <p><span lang=EN-US
    style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Georgia'>For many people that suffer from
                  conditions like diabetes limiting the amount of sugar that they eat it is
                  necessary in order to be healthy. Diabetes is a very serious disease and
                  controlling the amount of sugar that you eat if you’re diabetic is a very
                  serious matter.  It can be hard to find tasty chocolate treats that aren’t
                  packed with sugar and are allowed on a diabetic diet. Or maybe you or
                  someone in your family is a vegetarian or vegan so eating commercial
                  chocolate made with dairy products is off limits.</span></p>
                <p><span lang=EN-US
    style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Georgia'>Other people have
                  allergies to common ingredients that are found in chocolate like nuts and
                  can’t eat commercially produced chocolate because it might trigger their
                  allergies. If you thought that eating chocolate was going to be just a
                  happy memory because of your dietary or health concerns I have some good
                  news for you:</span></p>

                <p><span lang=EN-US
    style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Georgia'>It’s
                  true! You can have chocolate that won’t interfere with your dietary
                  restrictions or health issues.  Imagine being able to share a cup of
                  luscious hot chocolate with a loved one on a cold winter night or being
                  able to have a thick chocolate cake for your birthday.  Wouldn’t it be
                  great if you could eat a chocolate bar after a hard day? Or if you could
                  treat yourself to some fancy chocolate truffles when you finish that
                  project at work or make a deadline or get a promotion? Or if you could
                  enjoy a luxurious cup of hot chocolate with your partner before bed? You
                can have chocolate whenever you want!</span></p>
                <p ><span lang=EN-US
    style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Georgia'>Studies
                  have suggested that eating chocolate on a regular basis can have some
                  health benefits for people. Multiple studies have found that chocolate
                  contains flavonoids, a type of polyphenol antioxidant that may help to diminish
                such conditions as hypertension and heart disease.</span></p>

                  miss out on those health benefits, or the joy of eating really good
                  chocolate, anymore.  It’s true! Making your own homemade chocolate allows
                  you to control the ingredients and to control things like the amount of
                  sugar in the chocolate. Making your own homemade chocolate is the key to

                          By making chocolate yourself you know what is
                          inside. You won’t have to worry about artificial or harmful ingredients.

                          own needs. You can also make chocolate that has exactly the flavors that

                  certainly are aware, the price for really good chocolate is high. Gourmet
                  chocolate is expensive, not just because the ingredients are costly or the
                  manufacturing is expensive but because the skill and knowledge to make
                  really good chocolate is worth a lot. Let’s face it, the premium and
                  gourmet chocolates you can purchase have a huge price markup added on to
                  them. That’s the price you pay for buying a premium brand of anything and
                  the same goes with chocolate. But you can buy your own high quality ingredients
                  and avoid paying the markup the gourmet chocolate makers charge IF you know
                how to make your own chocolate.</span></p>
